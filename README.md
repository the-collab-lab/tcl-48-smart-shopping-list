## What is this project?

#### A “smart” shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you’re likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

## 🛠 Technologies

This application was built with React, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. Development of this application involved turning user stories into features, weekly pair programming sessions, QA testing, and code reviews.

### How does it work?

#### As a user, you will enter items (e.g., “Greek yogurt” or “Paper towels”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items.

#### All shopping lists are stored in Firebase. This means they won't get lost and are accessible from any device. This application allows you to create and share any number of different lists. To share it or access an existing list, simply enter the tree word token associated with your list.
